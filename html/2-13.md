must include images and descriptions of at least three different kinds of 
tree branches. There must be at least one unordered list, one ordered list, 
and one table. Detailed descriptions of the different branches must be 
stored in separate documents that are accessible through links from the 
home document. You must invent several practical uses for tree branches 
and include sales pitches for them.
