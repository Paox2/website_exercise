Create and test an HTML document that has six short paragraphs of text 
that describe various aspects of the state in which you live. You must define 
three different paragraph styles, p1, p2, and p3. The p1 style must use left 
and right margins of 20 pixels, a background color of pink, and a foreground 
color of blue. The p2 style must use left and right margins of 30 pixels, a 
background color of black, and a foreground color of yellow. The p3 style 
must use a text indent of 1 centimeter, a background color of green, and a 
foreground color of white. The first and fourth paragraphs must use p1, the 
second and fifth must use p2, and the third and sixth must use p3.
